GROUP BY member_casual;

--2) Find out how often each type of member used bike from december 2023 to april 2024
SELECT member_casual,

GROUP BY member_casual, start_hour
ORDER BY member_casual, start_hour;

SELECT member_casual,
  day_of_week,
  count(*) as num_rides
FROM `ornate-apricot-435209-g7.tripdata.clean_tripdata`
GROUP BY member_casual, day_of_week
ORDER BY member_casual, day_of_week;

SELECT member_casual,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM started_at) as month,
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM started_at) as year,
  COUNT(*) AS num_rides
FROM `ornate-apricot-435209-g7.tripdata.clean_tripdata`
GROUP BY member_casual, month, year
ORDER BY member_casual, month, year;
